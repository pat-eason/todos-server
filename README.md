# Todos Server

This was a simple repo to refamiliarize myself with Go and Gin.

## Getting Started

To run the application, end-to-end, simply run `docker-compose up` to get
the api image built and Mongodb started.

| Service | Port   |
| ------- | ------ |
| API     | `3001` |
| MongoDb | `3002` |
